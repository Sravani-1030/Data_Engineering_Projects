Project Title : DVD Rental Data Warehouse


This project is about creating a Data Warehouse using Postgresql and DVD rental dataset from Tutorial(https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/)
and learning how Data Warehouse is important for OLAP process.
The goal of this project is to determine which film DVD has got high revenue and in which city it happened.

Resources used:
1. Postgresql & its user interface PgAdmin
2. DVD rental Dataset

Process followed:
1. Install the Postgresql and PgAdmin. (PgAdmin is preferred instead of PSQL for better user experience.)
2. Create a Database and upload raw data from DVD rental dataset.
3. Draw the schema using any tool eg : Draw.io providing Dimension tables and fact tables
4. Based on the diagram create the dimension tables and fact tables in pgAdmin using SQL .
5. Load the data into the created tables.
6. Retrieve the required performance factor using Fact Tables.


Output Analysis:
Time taken to determine which film DVD has got high revenue and in which city it happened using Datawarehouse= 189ms(Approx)

Time taken to determine which film DVD has got high revenue and in which city it happened using Database = 321 ms(Approx)
